Hi, I'm Niraj. I build and optimize solutions in the Cloud.

Currently, I'm a Principal Site Reliability Engineer at OpenText, where I combine skills in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, and Cloud Architecture. My work includes AWS migrations, automating cloud infrastructure, and optimizing operations for cost savings. I focus on designing scalable solutions, improving cloud security, and also mentoring a high-performing team.

Previously, at JP Morgan Chase, I worked as Public Cloud SRE optimizing AWS infrastructure with automation and Terraform. In earlier roles at JP Morgan Chase, I worked on Middleware and Data transformation processes, implemented automation, and also managed vendor relationships.

I've got 7 active certifications in AWS (my favourite cloud service provider), with aim to be fully certified on all 12 AWS certifications soon. Check out my full list of active certifications including Kubernetes [here](docs/certifications.md)

You can view my detailed technical skills [here](docs/skills.md).

When I'm not working, you'll probably find me with my nose in a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178846143-niraj-gurupanchayan) or out running. I've run seven full marathons, including two virtual London Marathons, and several half marathons. I've also done over 100 parkruns :) I log all my runs and you can keep up with my running adventures on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21360851?hl=en-GB).

You can connect with me through these interests or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niraj-gurupanchayan/) I'm NOT on Facebook and Instagram :)
