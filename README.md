# Niraj Gurupanchayan

Hello,

I am currently a Principal Site Reliability Engineer @OpenText, where my role blends expertise from DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, and Cloud Architecture. This multifaceted position allows me to leverage a broad range of skills to ensure the reliability and scalability of our systems. I've spearheaded AWS migrations, automated cloud infrastructure, and optimized operational efficiency, including cost saving through strategic migrations. My role involves architecting scalable solutions, enhancing cloud security, and mentoring a high-performing team.

Previously, at JP Morgan Chase, as a Public Cloud Engineer at JP Morgan Chase, I optimized AWS infrastructure with automation, Terraform, and EKS, driving enhanced scalability and performance.

I hold a number of certifications in AWS, with aim to be fully certified in all AWS certifications. I'm also CKA and CKAD certified. My Terraform certificate expired last year.

You can view my detailed technical skills [here](docs/skills.md).

In my spare time, I am an avid reader of fiction, technical, and non-fiction books, and I’ve recently started logging my reading journey on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178846143-niraj-gurupanchayan).

Outside of work, running is a key part of my routine, contributing to both my physical and mental well-being. I’ve completed seven full marathons and several half marathons, including two virtual London Marathons to raise funds for charity. I’ve done over 100 parkruns :) I log all my runs and you can track my running on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21360851?hl=en-GB). 

Feel free to connect with me through these interests and achievements! Though I'm NOT on Facebook and Instagram, and I rarely check X :)
