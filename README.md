Hi, I am Niraj. I build and optimize solutions in the Cloud.

I am currently a Principal Site Reliability Engineer @OpenText, where my role blends expertise from DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, and Cloud Architecture. I've done AWS migrations, automated cloud infrastructure, and optimized operational efficiency, and cost savings through strategic migrations. My role involves architecting scalable solutions, enhancing cloud security, and mentoring a high-performing team.

Previously, at JP Morgan Chase, as a Public Cloud Engineer, I optimized AWS infrastructure with automation, Terraform, and EKS, driving enhanced scalability and performance.

I hold several certifications in AWS, my favourite cloud service provider, with aim to be fully certified on all AWS certifications.

You can view my detailed technical skills [here](docs/skills.md).

In my spare time, I am an avid reader of fiction, technical, and non-fiction books, and I’ve recently started logging my reading journey on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178846143-niraj-gurupanchayan).

Outside of work, running is a key part of my routine, contributing to both my physical and mental well-being. I’ve completed seven full marathons and several half marathons, including two virtual London Marathons to raise funds for charity. I’ve done over 100 parkruns :) I log all my runs and you can track my running on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21360851?hl=en-GB). 

I'm NOT on Facebook and Instagram, and I rarely check X, feel free to connect with me through these interests or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niraj-gurupanchayan/)!
