Hi, I am Niraj. I build and optimize solutions in the Cloud.

Currently, I am a Principal Site Reliability Engineer at OpenText, where I combine skills in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, and Cloud Architecture. My work includes AWS migrations, automating cloud infrastructure, and optimizing operations for cost savings. I focus on designing scalable solutions, improving cloud security, and mentoring a high-performing team.

Previously, a as a Public Cloud Engineer at JP Morgan Chase, I optimized AWS infrastructure with automation and Terraform.

I hold 7 active certifications in AWS (my favourite cloud service provider), with aim to be fully certified on all AWS certifications soon. Check out my full list of active certifications [here](docs/certifications.md)

You can view my detailed technical skills [here](docs/skills.md).

In my spare time, I am an avid reader, including technical books, and I’ve recently started logging my reading journey on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178846143-niraj-gurupanchayan).

Outside of work, RUNNING is a key part of my routine, contributing to both my physical and mental well-being. I’ve completed seven full marathons and several half marathons, including two virtual London Marathons to raise funds for charity. I’ve done over 100 parkruns :) I log all my runs and you can track my running on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21360851?hl=en-GB).
